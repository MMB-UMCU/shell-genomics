Your recommended group is: **Group Pro**.

In this group you will:
- Read through [Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics](mmb-umcu.github.io/shell-genomics).
- Work through [Data wrangling and processing](mmb-umcu.github.io/wranglign-genomics) using **CoCalc**, thus do not connect with ssh to the external server.
- Contribute to collaborative lesson development by clicking on the button on the top right of each lesson page ("Improve this page") and correcting issues by making at least one pull request or posting an issue on Github  

It will be possible to switch groups.
